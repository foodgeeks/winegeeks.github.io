  		<h3><a href="../../articles/142.html">Which Wine Pairs the Worst with Food?</a></h3>
  		<p>Great food pairings have been covered time and time again.  Sancerre with goat cheese, Chianti with Ragú Bolognese, Standing Rib Roast with Pauillac.  Yadda yadda yadda.  What is rarely talked about is which wines to avoid when seeking a great wine to compliment your food.  The fact is, most wines will work fine, but here are some wines to watch out for.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/138.html">Who is your Wine Idol?</a></h3>
  		<p>Various people have changed the wine industry in great or small ways, so much so that they have left a personal impression on our lives.  We recently asked the wine geeks to weigh in on their wine idols.  Thier answers may surprise you, and feel free to add your own Wine Idol to the comments area below the article.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/135.html">If you could be any Grape, which would you be?</a></h3>
  		<p>We Winegeeks talk about favorite wines, favorite wineries, favorite regions and grapes all the time.  But let&#039;s look at wine from another perspective... If you could be any grape varietal, which would it be?  Would you be Riesling so you could be graceful both in youth and old age, or would you rather be Cabernet Sauvignon so you had a little bite to your personality?</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/130.html">Best Bang for Buck Wine Region</a></h3>
  		<p>For a wine geek, one of the greatest feelings in the world is finding a lovely bottle of wine at a phenomenal value.  And with experience, we find that certain wine regions tend to offer wines at greater values than most other regions.  The Winegeeks writers recently compared notes and found that while they didn&#039;t agree that one specific region provided the best bang for buck wines, they did find one striking similarity between their selections.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/127.html">Wine Predictions for 2007</a></h3>
  		<p>Another year bites the dust and 2007 is well on its way.  The Winegeeks writers recently discussed the greatest wine trends of the previous year.  Now, they’re looking into the crystal balls to make their predictions on which events and trends will have the greatest effect on the wine industry in the year 2007.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/126.html">2006:  Looking Back on a Year of Wine</a></h3>
  		<p>While many things happened in the world of wine in 2006, it’s difficult to pin one certain event or trend that dominated or changed the industry.  From global warming to extracted Pinots, read on to see what each of the Winegeeks writers have to say out about the previous year.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/123.html">The Winegeeks Christmas Wishlist</a></h3>
  		<p>Ryan Snyder recently posed the question, &quot;What wine will you request from Santa this year?&quot; to the rest of the Wine Geeks staff.  Read on to see their official wishlist, which is currently en route to the North Pole.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/121.html">Thanksgiving Wine Pairings</a></h3>
  		<p>Thanksgiving is just a week away, and while Mom may have the turkey and the rest of the menu covered, what about the important part of the meal?  You know, the wine!  Ryan Snyder recently asked the Winegeeks writers what they think are the best wines to serve with Mr. Gobbles and the rest of the Thanksgiving meal.  While they provide a smorgasboard of responses, like most holiday dinners, you&#039;ll notice a number of similarities in their wine pairing choices!</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/119.html">Comfort Wines for Comfort Foods</a></h3>
  		<p>Now that the leaves are turning, the thermometer is dipping farther and farther each day, and nothing but football can be found on the tube over the weekend, we know autumn is officially here.  I recently asked the Winegeeks writers what culinary items they use to cope with the cold weather, and although their responses varied they all agreed that autumn is a wonderful season for food and wine pairing.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/110.html">Wines for the Labor Day Barbecue</a></h3>
  		<p>The days are growing shorter and the summer rays will soon be giving way to the changing leaves and bone-chilling breezes.  Labor Day may be our last chance to light up the grill without having to put a snow suit on first, so with that idea in mind we asked the Winegeeks writers what they would be grilling up and chugging down this holiday weekend.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/97.html">Favorite Summer Wine</a></h3>
  		<p>As a continuation of our Winegeeks&#039; opinions series, we recently asked all of the Winegeeks.com contributors to write about their favorite summer wines.  What follows is a geeky summary of all of our favorite summer quaffs:  Napa Cabernet, Shiraz, Port... just kidding.  Here&#039;s our whimsical approach to the world of wine, a bunch of opinions about grape juice and not a darn bit of stuffiness.</p>
  		
  	  		
  		<h3><a href="../../articles/92.html">Favorite Wine Regions</a></h3>
  		<p>When it comes to the world of wine, everyone has opinion and every opinion is valid.  This is the first of a series of monthly articles that will showcase the opinions of each of the Winegeeks.com writers, in order to provide numerous sides of a single topic.  We recently asked each of the Winegeeks.com writers to sound off on their favorite wine region, and each had a different response.</p>
